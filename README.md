# Poem-Inspired-Text-Generator-using-Probabilistic-Models
Designed a Poem-Inspired Text Generator employing probabilistic models based
on Markov Chains. Leveraging a poem by Robert Frost as inspiration, the project
processed the text to analyze word transitions and construct probabilistic
models for initial, first-order, and second-order word probabilities.
Implemented sampling techniques to generate coherent sentences resembling
the structure of the original poem.
